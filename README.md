# GPT-2_Text_Generation_with_Transformers

This repository contains a Python script for text generation using the GPT-2 model from the transformers library. The script installs necessary dependencies, loads a GPT-2 model trained on film scripts, and generates text based on the model's predictions.


# Installation

bash
Copy code
pip install transformers pandas matplotlib numpy nltk seaborn sklearn gensim pyldavis wordcloud textblob spacy textstat texthero
Usage
Install the required dependencies.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Script Overview
Installs essential dependencies for text generation.
Loads a GPT-2 model trained on film scripts.
Generates text samples based on the model's predictions.
Feel free to modify and experiment with the script to explore the creative text generation capabilities of GPT-2.

# Notes

The script utilizes the transformers library for easy integration with pre-trained models.
Adjust the max_length and num_samples parameters for varying text output lengths and quantities.
